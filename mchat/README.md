# Simple multi chat program <br>
User(s) connect to chat server to exchange messages.<br>
Spam the chat and you get banned for 10 seconds.

Ideas for future:
* Some kind of authorization
* Smarter solution for multiple clients (one thread per client will not scale).
* Ban users that tries to reconnect to often

## Usage: 
* cargo run
* telnet 127.0.0.1 7007
* Enter your name
* Start chatting
